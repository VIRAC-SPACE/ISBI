# Getting Help

Bug reports, feature requests and make contributions (e.g. code patches) can be reported by opening a &quot;new issue&quot; ticket on GitHub. Please give as much information (e.g. the software component, version) as you can in the ticket. For bugs, it is extremely useful if a small self-contained code snippet that reproduces the problem is provided.
